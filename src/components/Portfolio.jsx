                    <p class="lead">Whether or not you’re actually getting married at the beach, this wedding style is all about pairing nature-inspired details (seashells, driftwood, tropical flowers, etc.) with laid-back elements to create a casual, easygoing aesthetic. If you’re opting for beach wedding style, try to embody the carefree vibes that are synonymous with a seaside vacation. Beach style is also a fun excuse to try out non-traditional details, like mermaid wedding ideas, nautical details, or a modern tropical theme.</p>
